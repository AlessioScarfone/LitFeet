# LitFeet :video_game:
**LitFeet** is an isometric voxel-style puzzle game developed with Unity3D. 

The game is just a short demo developed as an exam project for the **"Game Programming"** course, followed during my master degree at the **"Universit√† della Calabria"** :mortar_board:.

The hero of the game is a small candle that with its limited skills will have to descend along a tower, full of traps and dangers, to recover a magic candle.
